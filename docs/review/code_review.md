## TASKS

**CRITICAL**: Comments must be removed first (affects file size calculations), then address file size violations.

### Task 1: Remove Comments from app/specifications/page.tsx
**File**: `app/specifications/page.tsx`
**Problem**: Contains 2 unnecessary comments that violate the no-comment policy
**Actions**:
- Remove comment on line 29: `// Filter products for To Do tab`
- Remove comment on line 44: `// Get unique brands for filter dropdown`

### Task 2: Fix File Size Violation in app/specifications/page.tsx
**File**: `app/specifications/page.tsx`
**Problem**: File is too large (166/150 lines) - exceeds component size limit by 11%
**Action**: Split into smaller modules or extract complex logic to separate files
**Note**: This task must be done after Task 1 (comment removal) as it affects line count

## VALIDATION COMMANDS

After implementing fixes, verify with:

```bash
# Validate specific file
cmd /c node docs/scripts/code-review-analyzer.js app/specifications/page.tsx

# Check file size after comment removal
cmd /c node docs/scripts/code-size.js app/specifications/page.tsx

# Full validation of all modified files
cmd /c node docs/scripts/code-review-analyzer.js app/ai-specifications/page.tsx app/products/page.tsx app/specifications/page.tsx components/dashboard/DashboardTabNavigation.tsx components/layout/NavContent.tsx components/shared/ItemList/ItemList.tsx components/shared/ProductSelector/ProductRow.tsx components/specifications/AISpecificationMarkdownViewer.tsx components/specifications/SpecificationsTabNavigation.tsx components/wizard/steps/ProductSelection.tsx
```

## ANALYSIS DETAILS

### Comments Detection
- Total violations: 2 comments found in 1 file
- All comments are inline documentation that should be removed per policy
- Comment removal is mandatory and must be done first

### File Size Analysis  
- 1 file exceeds component size limit (150 lines)
- Current size: 166 lines (11% over limit)
- Size check must be repeated after comment removal

### Code Quality Status
- ESLint: All files passed with no errors or warnings
- TypeScript: All functions have explicit return types
- React: All components follow proper patterns with useCallback/useMemo where needed
- Fallback Data: No violations detected - all files follow fail-fast principle

**ALL TASKS ARE MANDATORY AND MUST BE COMPLETED**
