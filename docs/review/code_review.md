## TASKS (MANDATORY - Fix in sequence order)

### Task 1: Remove inline comments from app/products/page.tsx
**File**: app/products/page.tsx  
**Problem**: Contains 2 inline comments that must be removed per code standards

**Comments to remove**:
- Line 7: `// Stable empty array to prevent infinite re-renders`
- Line 12: `// For testing multi-select: show alert with selected products`

### Task 2: Add useCallback to event handlers in ProductSelectorAdapter.tsx  
**File**: components/shared/ProductSelector/ProductSelectorAdapter.tsx  
**Problem**: Event handlers should use useCallback for performance optimization  
**Issue**: React performance optimization missing - event handlers need useCallback wrapping
