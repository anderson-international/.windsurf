# Deployment & Environment Documentation

*Centralized deployment strategy and environment configuration for the Specification Builder project.*

## Overview

This document provides strategic guidance for deployment and environment decisions. Focus is on simplicity and reliability for a solo hobbyist project with streamlined deployment workflows.

## Deployment Strategy

**Core Approach**: Platform-as-a-Service deployment with minimal configuration and automated deployment pipelines.

### Platform Philosophy
- **PaaS Integration**: Leverage platform services for simplified deployment
- **Git-Based Deployment**: Automatic deployment from version control
- **Environment Parity**: Consistent configuration across development and production
- **Minimal Infrastructure**: Avoid complex server management and orchestration

### Deployment Workflow
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automatic deployment from main branch
- **Preview Environments**: Staging deployments for feature branches
- **Rollback Capability**: Simple rollback to previous working versions
- **Zero-Downtime**: Seamless deployments without service interruption

## Environment Configuration

**Philosophy**: Environment-specific configuration with secure credential management and clear separation between environments.

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: All environment-specific values in environment variables
- **Secure Secrets**: Sensitive data encrypted and managed by platform
- **Default Values**: Sensible defaults for development environment
- **Configuration Validation**: Verify required configuration at startup

### Environment Separation
- **Development**: Local development with test data and debug features
- **Production**: Live environment with production data and security
- **Clear Boundaries**: Distinct configuration and data isolation
- **Environment Detection**: Runtime detection of current environment

## Infrastructure Strategy

### Database Hosting
- **Managed Database**: Platform-managed database service
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- **Scaling Approach**: Simple vertical scaling for growing data needs

### Static Asset Management
- **CDN Integration**: Content delivery network for static assets
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image compression and format conversion
- **Caching Strategy**: Appropriate caching headers for static content
- **Build Optimization**: Minification and bundling for production builds

## Development Environment

### Local Setup
- **Simple Installation**: Minimal setup requirements for new development
- **Environment Isolation**: Local development independent of production
- **Database Access**: Local database or development database connection
- **Hot Reload**: Fast development feedback with live code reloading

### Development Tools
- **Code Quality**: Linting and formatting integrated into development workflow
- **Environment Validation**: Verify development environment configuration
- **Local Testing**: Run tests locally before deployment
- **Debug Support**: Development-only debugging and profiling tools

## Security Considerations

### Environment Security
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and rotation of API keys and secrets
- **Network Security**: Appropriate network restrictions and HTTPS enforcement
- **Access Control**: Limited access to production environment and data
- **Audit Logging**: Basic logging for security-relevant environment access

### Deployment Security
- **Secure Deployment**: Encrypted deployment pipelines and artifact storage
- **Environment Isolation**: Production environment isolated from development
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates for dependencies
- **Minimal Permissions**: Least-privilege access for deployment and runtime

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Basic Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Simple application health monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Capture and alert on application errors
- **Performance Monitoring**: Basic performance metrics and alerting
- **Uptime Monitoring**: External monitoring for service availability

### Maintenance Workflow
- **Regular Updates**: Schedule for dependency and security updates
- **Backup Verification**: Regular testing of backup and recovery procedures
- **Performance Review**: Periodic review of application performance
- **Capacity Planning**: Monitor usage patterns for scaling decisions
