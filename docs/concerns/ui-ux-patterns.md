# UI/UX Patterns Documentation

*Centralized user interface and experience strategy for the Specification Builder project.*

## Overview

This document provides strategic guidance for UI/UX decisions and patterns. Focus is on simplicity and consistency for a solo hobbyist project with mobile-first responsive design.

## Styling Strategy

**Core Approach**: Component-scoped styling with clear naming conventions and minimal global styles.

### CSS Philosophy
- **Component-Scoped**: Styles tied directly to individual components
- **Descriptive Naming**: Clear, semantic class names that reflect component structure
- **Minimal Global Styles**: Avoid large shared stylesheets and global dependencies
- **Simple Patterns**: Straightforward styling approaches for solo development

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-First**: Design and implement for mobile devices first
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add desktop features as screen size increases
- **Flexible Layouts**: Use responsive patterns that work across device sizes
- **Performance Focus**: Optimize for mobile performance and loading times

## Component Organization

**Philosophy**: Modular, reusable components with clear responsibilities and reasonable size limits.

### Component Structure
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component handles one clear purpose
- **Reasonable Size**: Keep components focused and maintainable
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Build complex UIs from simple component combinations
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined props and consistent API patterns

### File Organization
- **Feature-Based**: Group related components by functionality
- **Co-location**: Keep component files near related logic and styles
- **Shared Components**: Common UI elements in dedicated shared directory
- **Clear Naming**: Consistent file and component naming conventions

## User Experience Patterns

### Navigation Strategy
- **Simple Structure**: Clear, intuitive navigation hierarchy
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Touch-friendly navigation for mobile devices
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized navigation behaviors across the application
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Interaction Patterns
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual feedback for user actions
- **Loading States**: Clear indication of async operations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and recovery options
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show information as needed, avoid overwhelming users

## Design System Approach

**Strategy**: Lightweight design system with consistent patterns and reusable components.

### Color and Typography
- **Limited Palette**: Small, focused color scheme for consistency
- **Semantic Colors**: Colors that convey meaning (success, error, warning)
- **Readable Typography**: Font choices optimized for readability across devices
- **Consistent Spacing**: Standardized spacing and sizing patterns

### Component Patterns
- **Consistent Behaviors**: Similar components behave in predictable ways
- **Reusable Elements**: Common patterns like buttons, forms, and cards
- **State Variations**: Clear visual states (disabled, loading, error, success)
- **Flexible Sizing**: Components that adapt to different content and contexts

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategy
- **Image Optimization**: Appropriate image formats and sizing for web delivery
- **Code Splitting**: Load only necessary CSS and JavaScript for each page
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid heavy UI libraries for simple styling needs
- **Efficient Rendering**: Minimize unnecessary re-renders and DOM manipulations

### Development Workflow
- **Style Organization**: Clear patterns for organizing and maintaining styles
- **Component Testing**: Basic testing for critical UI components
- **Browser Compatibility**: Focus on modern browsers with graceful degradation
- **Development Tools**: Simple tooling for style debugging and optimization

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Core Principles
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper semantic markup and ARIA labels
- **Color Accessibility**: Sufficient contrast ratios and color-independent information
- **Focus Management**: Clear visual focus indicators and logical tab order

### Implementation Patterns
- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Error Accessibility**: Screen reader accessible error messages and validation
- **Skip Links**: Navigation shortcuts for keyboard and screen reader users
