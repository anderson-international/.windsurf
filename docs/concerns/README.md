| **[ui-ux-patterns.md](./ui-ux-patterns.md)** | UI/UX design implementation | Component styling, mobile-first design, accessibility, performance patterns |

### System Architecture & Operations

| Document | Purpose | Key Content |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **[deployment-environment.md](./deployment-environment.md)** | Deployment and infrastructure | Environment configuration, security, monitoring, CI/CD pipeline |
| **[performance-optimization.md](./performance-optimization.md)** | Application performance strategy | Frontend/backend optimization, caching, database queries, monitoring |
| **[testing-strategy.md](./testing-strategy.md)** | Quality assurance approach | Manual vs automated testing, unit/integration tests, development workflow |

## How to Use These Documents

### For Developers Working On:

#### **Authentication Issues**
- Start with **authentication.md** for magic link implementation
- Reference **api-design.md** for auth-related API endpoints
- Check **deployment-environment.md** for environment variables

#### **Form Development**
- **form-management.md** - React Hook Form patterns and validation
- **ui-ux-patterns.md** - Mobile-first form styling
- **api-design.md** - Form submission endpoints

#### **Database Operations**
- **database.md** - Schema design and query optimization
- **performance-optimization.md** - Database performance tuning
- **api-design.md** - Data validation and error handling

#### **Performance Issues**
- **performance-optimization.md** - Comprehensive optimization strategies
- **database.md** - Query performance
- **ui-ux-patterns.md** - Frontend performance patterns

#### **Deployment & DevOps**
- **deployment-environment.md** - Infrastructure and deployment
- **testing-strategy.md** - CI/CD integration
- **performance-optimization.md** - Production monitoring

### Problem-Solving Workflow

```
1. Identify the technical domain of your challenge
   ↓
2. Consult the relevant concern document
   ↓
3. Cross-reference related concerns (see relationships below)
   ↓
4. Apply patterns from project guides (../guides/)
   ↓
5. Validate against project requirements (../project/)
```

## Document Relationships

### Core Dependencies
```
authentication.md
├── Depends on → api-design.md (auth endpoints)
├── Depends on → deployment-environment.md (env variables)
└── Related to → testing-strategy.md (auth testing)

form-management.md
├── Depends on → ui-ux-patterns.md (form styling)
├── Depends on → api-design.md (form endpoints)
└── Related to → performance-optimization.md (form performance)

database.md
├── Related to → api-design.md (data validation)
├── Related to → performance-optimization.md (query performance)
└── Depends on → deployment-environment.md (database config)
```

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Performance**: Addressed across multiple documents (performance-optimization.md, database.md, ui-ux-patterns.md)
- **Security**: Spans authentication.md, api-design.md, deployment-environment.md
- **Testing**: Primary in testing-strategy.md, referenced across all technical domains

## Document Maintenance

### Update Triggers
- **New technical challenges** discovered during development
- **Performance bottlenecks** requiring strategic solutions
- **Security vulnerabilities** or compliance requirements
- **Technology stack changes** affecting implementation patterns

### Consistency Guidelines
- Solutions should align with project standards (../guides/)
- Performance recommendations must be measurable
- Security patterns should follow industry best practices
- All recommendations should consider the solo developer context

## Integration with Other Documentation

### Project Guides (../guides/)
- Technical concerns implement the principles defined in project guides
- Architectural guidelines provide the framework; concerns provide specific solutions

### Project Requirements (../project/)
- Business context drives technical concern priorities
- Feature requirements inform technical implementation strategies

### Implementation Workflow
1. **Requirements** (../project/) → Define what needs to be built
2. **Guides** (../guides/) → Establish how to build consistently  
3. **Concerns** (this folder) → Solve specific technical challenges
4. **Implementation** → Apply solutions in codebase
