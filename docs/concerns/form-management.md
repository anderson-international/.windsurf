# Form Management Documentation

*Centralized form handling strategy and implementation patterns for the Specification Builder project.*

## Overview

This document provides strategic guidance for form management decisions and patterns. Focus is on simplicity and consistency for a solo hobbyist project with type-safe validation.

## Form Strategy

**Core Approach**: React Hook Form with schema-based validation for all form interactions.

### Technology Philosophy
- **React Hook Form**: Single form library for all form handling needs
- **Schema Validation**: Type-safe validation with consistent error handling
- **Performance Focus**: Minimize re-renders and optimize user experience
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep form logic separate from UI components

### Form Complexity Decision Framework

**Simple Forms**: Basic validation, single-step interaction
- **Approach**: Standard form handling with validation
- **Use Case**: Login, simple settings, basic data entry

**Complex Forms**: Multi-step wizards, conditional logic, extensive validation
- **Approach**: Enhanced patterns with step management
- **Use Case**: Multi-step data creation, complex business workflows

**Minimal Forms**: Basic required fields only
- **Approach**: Simplified patterns with minimal validation
- **Use Case**: Quick actions, simple confirmations

## Validation Strategy

**Philosophy**: Schema-driven validation with consistent error handling and type safety.

### Validation Patterns
- **Schema-First**: Define validation rules before implementation
- **Client-Server Consistency**: Share validation logic between frontend and backend
- **Progressive Validation**: Validate as user progresses through form
- **Clear Feedback**: Immediate, actionable error messages

### Error Handling
- **Explicit Errors**: Never hide validation failures
- **Field-Level Feedback**: Show errors at the field level when possible
- **Form-Level Feedback**: Display overall form status and submission errors
- **Consistent Messaging**: Standardized error message patterns

## Multi-Step Form Strategy

**Approach**: Step-based form management with validation at each stage.

### Step Management
- **Progressive Validation**: Validate current step before advancing
- **State Persistence**: Maintain form state across steps
- **Navigation Control**: Allow backward navigation with data preservation
- **Visual Progress**: Clear indication of current step and overall progress

### Data Flow Patterns
- **Step Isolation**: Each step handles its own validation and data
- **Centralized State**: Form data managed in single location
- **Async Validation**: Handle server-side validation without blocking UI
- **Draft Saving**: Optional auto-save for long forms

## Integration Patterns

### Component Integration
- **Hook-Based**: Custom hooks for form logic encapsulation
- **Provider Pattern**: Share form context across related components
- **Controlled Components**: Maintain consistent data flow
- **Reusable Patterns**: Common form components and validation logic

### API Integration
- **Submission Handling**: Consistent patterns for form submission to APIs
- **Error Mapping**: Convert API errors to form field errors
- **Loading States**: Handle async submission with appropriate UI feedback
- **Success Handling**: Consistent post-submission user flows

## Development Patterns

### Form Organization
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate form logic in reusable hooks
- **Validation Schemas**: Centralized schema definitions for reuse
- **Form Components**: Modular, testable form components
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for form data types

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Test form logic and validation independently
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete form workflows
- **User Flow Testing**: Validate end-to-end form experiences
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Test validation and error handling

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Patterns
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Optimize form performance for complex forms
- **Debounced Validation**: Avoid excessive validation calls during typing
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only render necessary form sections
- **Memory Management**: Clean up form state when components unmount
