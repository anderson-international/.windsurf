# Current Implementation Plan

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-11  
**Status**: Planning Phase â†’ Implementation Ready

## Current Project State

### âœ… Completed Planning
- [x] Comprehensive project blueprint defined ([project-blueprint.md](./project-blueprint.md))
- [x] Architectural guidelines established ([architectural-guidelines.md](./architectural-guidelines.md))
- [x] Database schema designed and implemented in NeonDB ([db-schema.txt](./db-schema.txt))
- [x] Technical stack decisions finalized
- [x] User stories and workflows documented

### ðŸš§ Current Status
- **Project**: Empty Next.js project (tech stack only)
- **Database**: Live in NeonDB with pending status workflow updates
- **Phase**: Ready to begin implementation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Goal**: Get basic application running with authentication and database connectivity

#### 1.1 Database Finalization âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] **1. Schema Documentation Automation**
  - âœ… Created `npm run sync-schema` script for AI-optimized schema documentation
  - âœ… Auto-generates `docs/db-schema.txt` with form hints, validation rules, relationships
  - âœ… Fully functional and tested with 21 tables

- [x] **2. User Role Normalization**  
  - âœ… Dropped old `role` TEXT column from users table
  - âœ… Confirmed foreign key constraint: `users.role_id â†’ enum_roles.id`
  - âœ… Clean enum-based role system (Admin, Expert, Public)

- [x] **3. Status Workflow Implementation**
  - âœ… Verified enum_specification_statuses: draft(1), published(2), needs_revision(3), under_review(4)
  - âœ… All 1,286 specifications have valid status_id values
  - âœ… Foreign key constraint confirmed: `specifications.status_id â†’ enum_specification_statuses.id`

- [x] **4. Product Sync Strategy Finalization**
  - âœ… Database-driven approach with pg_cron scheduled sync
  - âœ… Incremental sync using Shopify's `updated_at` timestamps
  - âœ… Soft delete strategy for removed products
  - âœ… Development subset â†’ manual full sync â†’ automated production approach

- [x] **5. Documentation Integration**
  - âœ… Consolidated all database planning into `docs/project/architectural-guidelines.md`
  - âœ… Removed conflicting/outdated information from other project files
  - âœ… Established single source of truth for database architecture

#### 1.2 Next.js Application Setup
- [ ] **Initialize Next.js app with required dependencies**
  - Next.js 14+ (App Router)
  - Prisma ORM
  - Authentication library (NextAuth.js or similar)
  - UI components (Tailwind CSS + headlessUI or similar)
  - Form handling (React Hook Form + Zod validation)
- [ ] **Configure environment variables and database connection**
- [ ] **Set up basic project structure following architectural guidelines**

#### 1.3 Authentication System
- [ ] **Implement development authentication** (user dropdown)
- [ ] **Set up role-based access control** (Admin vs Reviewer)
- [ ] **Create protected route middleware**
- [ ] **Plan magic link authentication** (production - Phase 2)

### Phase 2: Core Features (MVP)
**Goal**: Build essential specification management functionality

#### 2.1 Product Discovery System
- [ ] **Implement products table and Shopify sync**
  - Create `products` table schema
  - Build `refresh_shopify_products()` stored procedure
  - Set up pg_cron scheduled refresh
  - Create admin API endpoint for manual refresh
- [ ] **Build product cards with review indicators**
- [ ] **Implement filtering and search functionality**

#### 2.2 Specification Management
- [ ] **Create specification list views** (grouped by status)
- [ ] **Build multi-step specification form wizard**
- [ ] **Implement draft/published workflow**
- [ ] **Add form validation and error handling**

#### 2.3 User Interface
- [ ] **Implement mobile-first responsive design**
- [ ] **Create collapsible left navigation**
- [ ] **Build specification status groupings**
- [ ] **Add progress tracking displays**

### Phase 3: Quality & Polish
**Goal**: Refine user experience and add admin capabilities

#### 3.1 Admin Features
- [ ] **Complete admin CRUD operations**
- [ ] **Build user management interface**
- [ ] **Create enum value management**
- [ ] **Add data export functionality**

#### 3.2 Production Readiness
- [ ] **Implement magic link authentication**
- [ ] **Add comprehensive error handling**
- [ ] **Performance optimization**
- [ ] **Testing and quality assurance**

## Next Immediate Steps

### Step 1: Next.js Foundation (Estimated: 4-6 hours)
**Priority**: High - Required for all subsequent development

**Tasks**:
- Initialize Next.js project with App Router
- Install and configure Prisma ORM
- Set up basic authentication (development mode)
- Create initial project structure
- Implement database connection and basic queries

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Application runs locally without errors
- Database connection is established
- Basic authentication is functional
- Project structure follows architectural guidelines

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### Technical Decisions
1. **UI Component Library**: 
   - Option A: Tailwind CSS + HeadlessUI (lightweight, flexible)
   - Option B: Material-UI or similar (more components, heavier)
   - **Recommendation**: Tailwind + HeadlessUI for mobile-first approach

2. **Form Management**:
   - Multi-step wizard implementation approach
   - Draft persistence strategy (local storage vs database)

3. **Authentication Library**:
   - NextAuth.js vs Auth0 vs custom solution
   - Magic link implementation details

### Business Logic Questions
1. **Specification Status Workflow**:
   - Who can change status from draft â†’ published?
   - Admin approval process for published specifications?
   - Auto-save frequency for drafts?

2. **Product Sync Strategy**:
   - How to handle Shopify product deletions/changes?
   - Fallback behavior when Shopify API is unavailable?

## Progress Tracking

### Current Sprint Focus
**Week of 2025-06-11**: Next.js foundation setup

### Success Metrics
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Can create, edit, and view specifications with proper authentication
- **Phase 2 Complete**: Full MVP functionality with product discovery
- **Phase 3 Complete**: Production-ready application with admin features
