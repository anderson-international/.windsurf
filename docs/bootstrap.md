## üöÄ Quick Start Checklist

### 1. üìö **INGEST CORE DOCUMENTATION**
**Priority**: Critical - Always start here

**Essential Reading Order**:
1. **[docs/our-plan.md](./our-plan.md)** - Current project status and implementation roadmap
2. **[docs/project/business-context.md](./project/business-context.md)** - Business objectives and user needs
3. **[docs/project/technical-stack.md](./project/technical-stack.md)** - Architecture decisions and technology choices
4. **[docs/project/ui-ux-design.md](./project/ui-ux-design.md)** - Mobile-first design system and patterns
5. **[docs/concerns/ui-ux-patterns.md](./concerns/ui-ux-patterns.md)** - Implementation guidelines for UI/UX

**Why This Matters**: These documents contain the strategic context that drives all technical decisions.

### 2. üîß **READ GLOBAL RULES**
**File**: `.windsurf/global_rules.md`

**Critical Rules to Remember**:
- Windows command syntax: Always use `cmd /c` prefix for most commands
- Git operations: Use single-word commit messages to avoid quote issues
- Question approach: Ask questions one at a time, focus on single topics
- Rule synchronization: Maintain copies in both primary location and git-tracked location

### 3. üìã **READ MEMORIES**
**Priority**: High - Contains user preferences and learnings

**Key Memory Topics**:
- Windows command execution patterns
- Directory creation best practices
- Session management (understanding "Continue" command)
- User preferences and workflow patterns

### 4. üéØ **PHASE-SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION**
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - UI Components & Form Wizard

**Next Step Focus Reading**:
- **[docs/project/ui-ux-design.md](./project/ui-ux-design.md)** - Mobile-first component design
- **[docs/concerns/ui-ux-patterns.md](./concerns/ui-ux-patterns.md)** - Component patterns and styling strategy
- **[docs/project/feature-requirements.md](./project/feature-requirements.md)** - Specification form requirements
- **[docs/db-schema.txt](./db-schema.txt)** - Database schema for form validation

## üí° Critical Learnings from Session (2025-06-11)

### **Technical Achievements**
1. **Next.js 15 Migration Complete**
   - Successfully upgraded from Next.js 14 to 15.3.3
   - Fixed breaking changes in route parameter handling (async params)
   - All API endpoints updated to use `await params` pattern

2. **Comprehensive Type Safety Implemented**
   - Created dedicated `types/enum.ts` with full TypeScript support
   - Eliminated all `any` types with proper type-safe alternatives
   - Built `getEnumTable()` helper for dynamic Prisma access
   - Zero lint warnings/errors achieved

3. **Modern Dependency Stack**
   - Node.js 22.15.1 compatibility confirmed
   - All packages updated to latest compatible versions
   - Build system optimized for Next.js 15

4. **NextAuth 5.x Integration**
   - NextAuth upgraded to 5.0.0-beta with new API structure
   - EmailProvider temporarily disabled due to Edge Runtime incompatibility
   - Authentication middleware updated for NextAuth 5.x patterns

### **Development Workflow Insights**
1. **Windows Command Execution**
   - `cmd /c` prefix essential for reliable command execution
   - Git operations work best with single-word commit messages
   - PowerShell as fallback for complex operations

2. **Lint-Driven Development**
   - ESLint configuration simplified for compatibility
   - Type safety improvements eliminate runtime errors
   - Clean lint results = production-ready code

3. **Breaking Change Management**
   - Major version upgrades require careful testing
   - Next.js 15 route parameter changes were significant
   - Always verify build after major dependency updates

### **Architecture Decisions**
1. **Type-Safe Dynamic Database Access**
   - Custom TypeScript interfaces for dynamic Prisma operations
   - Enum table validation with Zod schemas
   - Reference checking for safe deletions

2. **API Design Patterns**
   - Consistent error handling with proper HTTP status codes
   - Validation-first approach with comprehensive Zod schemas
   - Type-safe response utilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Technical State

### **‚úÖ Completed Foundation**
- **Build System**: Next.js 15, zero errors, fast compilation
- **Dependencies**: Latest compatible versions across all packages
- **Code Quality**: Perfect lint score, comprehensive type safety
- **API Infrastructure**: Full CRUD operations with type safety
- **Authentication**: NextAuth 5.x with development auth working
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with complete schema integration

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues**
1. **NextAuth EmailProvider**: Disabled due to Edge Runtime incompatibility
   - **Solution Path**: Configure nodemailer with Node.js runtime
   - **Priority**: Medium (Phase 3 requirement)

2. **Production Authentication**: Magic link flow incomplete
   - **Dependency**: EmailProvider resolution
   - **Timeline**: Phase 3 implementation

### **üéØ Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Product Card Components** (Week 1 focus)
2. **Form Wizard Implementation** (Week 2-3 focus)
3. **Mobile-First UI Components** (Ongoing)

## üìã Session Continuation Checklist

When resuming development work:

### **Pre-Work Verification**
- [ ] Read updated `docs/our-plan.md` for current status
- [ ] Check global rules for any updates
- [ ] Review relevant memories for context
- [ ] Verify build still passes: `npm run build`
- [ ] Confirm lint still clean: `npm run lint`

### **Development Environment**
- [ ] Node.js 22.15.1 confirmed
- [ ] Next.js 15.3.3 with modern features
- [ ] Database connection to NeonDB working
- [ ] Development authentication functional

### **Phase 2 Focus Areas**
- [ ] Review mobile-first design requirements
- [ ] Understand specification form requirements
- [ ] Plan component architecture and styling
- [ ] Consider form state management approach

## üîÑ Session Management

### **Understanding "Continue" Command**
- **Purpose**: Technical workaround for Windsurf IDE session limitations
- **Action**: NOT an instruction to proceed with tasks
- **Response**: Acknowledge session resumption, wait for explicit direction
- **Never**: Start new tasks or assume permission to continue automatically

### **Effective Collaboration Patterns**
- **Questions**: One at a time, focused on single topics
- **Documentation**: Always reference and update as work progresses
- **Planning**: Update plan when scope or direction changes
- **Communication**: Be concise, avoid verbosity, focus on specific tasks
