# Project Documentation

This folder contains the core project documentation broken down from the original project blueprint into focused, category-specific documents.

## Document Overview

### Core Project Documents

| Document | Purpose | Key Content |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **[business-context.md](./business-context.md)** | Business requirements and user context | Business problem, user types, workflows, authentication strategy |
| **[feature-requirements.md](./feature-requirements.md)** | Detailed feature specifications | MVP features, post-MVP roadmap, field requirements, validation rules |
| **[ui-ux-design.md](./ui-ux-design.md)** | User interface and experience design | Mobile-first design, navigation structure, form layout, visual design |
| **[technical-stack.md](./technical-stack.md)** | Technology choices and architecture | Framework decisions, database ORM, API design, deployment strategy |
