## How to Update Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. First, check this overview to find the appropriate document for your changes
2. Update the primary document for that topic
3. Add cross-references in other documents rather than duplicating content
4. Update this overview if you add new documents or change the relationship between documents

This approach ensures documentation remains consistent while minimizing duplication.
