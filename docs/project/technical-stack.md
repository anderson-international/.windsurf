# Technical Stack Decisions

<!-- AI_NAVIGATION
Reading Priority: 1 (Critical - Essential technology choices for all development)
Primary Focus: Framework selection rationale, implementation strategies, and deployment decisions for Next.js 15, Prisma ORM, CSS Modules, and Netlify deployment
Key Compliance Points:
- Next.js 15 App Router architecture and component boundaries (line 8-47)
- CSS Modules implementation with mobile-first design (line 49-60)
- Prisma ORM type-safe database patterns (line 62-69)
- React Hook Form with Zod validation strategy (line 77-85)
Critical Cross-references:
- UI/UX Design (ui-ux-design.md): Styling philosophy and design system that complements technical choices
- React Development Patterns (../guides/react-patterns.md): React 18 patterns and performance optimization
- Database-Form Integration (../guides/database-form-integration.md): Prisma and form integration patterns
- Deployment Environment (../concerns/deployment-environment.md): Netlify deployment configuration and environment setup
Anti-patterns:
- Mixing App Router and Pages Router patterns
- Using client components when server components would suffice
- Ignoring the mobile-first CSS implementation strategy
- Missing type safety with Prisma generated types
Additional Context: This document establishes the foundational technology decisions that all implementation must follow for consistency and maintainability
-->

<!-- AI_SUMMARY
This document establishes the technical stack decisions for the Specification Builder project with these key components:

â€¢ Next.js 15 App Router Framework - React-based with server-side rendering, mobile optimization, built-in API routes, and clear server/client component boundaries
â€¢ CSS Modules Styling - Built-in Next.js support with automatic scoping, global theme variables, and mobile-first responsive design patterns
â€¢ Prisma Database ORM - Type-safe database access with auto-generated types, migration system, and excellent developer experience
â€¢ React Hook Form + Zod Validation - Multi-step wizard forms with controlled progression, schema validation, and draft saving capabilities
â€¢ RESTful API Design - Next.js App Router endpoints for specifications, enum management, authentication, and admin operations
â€¢ Netlify Deployment - Platform-as-a-service with Windsurf IDE integration, environment variables, and preview environments

The stack prioritizes type safety, developer experience, and mobile performance while maintaining simplicity suitable for solo hobbyist development.

## Frontend Framework

### Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Decision**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Rationale**: 
  - React-based with strong ecosystem
  - Excellent mobile performance
  - Server-side rendering for fast initial loads
  - Built-in API routes
  - Image optimization for product images
- **Framework Architecture:**
  - **App Router**: File-system based routing with `app/` directory
  - **Server Components**: Default rendering mode
  - **Client Components**: Explicit `'use client'` directive
  - **Server Actions**: Built-in form handling with `'use server'`

- **Component Boundary Strategy:**
```typescript
// Server Component (default)
export default async function ProductsPage(): Promise<JSX.Element> {
  const products = await prisma.product.findMany();
  return <ProductList products={products} />;
}

// Client Component
'use client';
export default function ProductFilters(): JSX.Element {
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('');
  // Browser APIs and event handlers
}
```

- **File Structure:**
```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx      # Root layout
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx        # Home page
â”œâ”€â”€ products/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx  # Products layout  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx    # Products listing
â””â”€â”€ create-specification/
    â””â”€â”€ page.tsx    # Form wizard
```

## CSS/Styling Implementation

### CSS Modules
- **Decision**: CSS Modules
- **Technical Benefits**:
  - Built into Next.js (no dependencies)
  - Automatic style scoping
  - Zero runtime overhead
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Global CSS variables for theme colors
  - Component-specific `.module.css` files
  - Mobile-first responsive design

## Database ORM

### Prisma
- **Decision**: Prisma
- **Rationale**:
  - Type-safe database access
  - Auto-generated types from schema
  - Excellent developer experience
  - Powerful migration system

## UI Component Library

### Headless UI + Custom Components
- **Decision**: Headless UI for complex components + custom for simple ones
- **Use Headless UI for**:
  - Combobox (product search with autocomplete)
  - Listbox (dropdowns like brand filter)

## Form State Management

### React Hook Form with Zod
- **Library**: React Hook Form with Zod schemas
- **Implementation**:
  - Multi-step wizard with controlled progression
  - Custom hook for form state across steps
  - Step validation before progression
  - Draft saving via status field

## API Design

### RESTful with Next.js App Router
- **Pattern**: RESTful endpoints with Next.js App Router
- **Key Routes**:
  - `/api/specifications` - Specification management
  - `/api/enum/[table]` - Enum table operations
  - `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
  - `/api/admin/refresh-products` - Product refresh trigger

## Data Validation

### Zod Schema Validation
- **Strategy**: Single source of truth with Zod schemas
- **Implementation**:
  - Shared schemas between client and server
  - Type-safe validation with TypeScript
  - Integration with React Hook Form
  - Consistent error messaging

## Product Data Management

### Database-Driven Sync Strategy
- **Approach**: Database-driven with scheduled and manual refresh
- **Implementation**: For technical implementation details, see the [Technical Stack](technical-stack.md) document

## Deployment

### Netlify
- **Platform**: Netlify via Windsurf IDE integration
- **Configuration**: netlify.toml with environment variables
- **Benefits**: Seamless deployment, preview environments, excellent Next.js support
