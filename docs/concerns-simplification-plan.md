# Plan for Simplifying Documents in `docs/concerns` Folder

This document outlines our systematic approach to simplify all documentation files in the `docs/concerns` folder, following the successful process used with the `docs/guides`, `docs/pitfalls`, and `docs/project` folders.

## Preparation Phase
1. **List all files in `docs/concerns`** to identify the complete scope of work
2. **Examine file relationships** to understand cross-references and dependencies
3. **Prioritize files** based on complexity and importance

## File Processing Workflow (For Each File)
1. **Initial Analysis**
   - View the complete content of the file
   - Identify key sections, AI navigation blocks, and critical content
   - Note validation patterns, priority markers, or special formatting

2. **Simplification Process**
   - Create a temporary simplified version (`[filename]-simplified.md`)
   - Preserve all AI navigation blocks (never remove these)
   - Maintain all priority markers (‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL, üî• HIGH, etc.)
   - Keep AI validation regex patterns intact
   - Preserve critical code examples and technical details
   - Streamline text while maintaining important information
   - Remove redundancies while preserving meaning

3. **File Replacement**
   - Replace original file with simplified version using Windows command:
     ```
     cmd /c copy /Y c:\Users\Jonny\Code\specifications\docs\concerns\[filename]-simplified.md c:\Users\Jonny\Code\specifications\docs\concerns\[filename].md
     ```
   - Delete temporary simplified file:
     ```
     cmd /c del c:\Users\Jonny\Code\specifications\docs\concerns\[filename]-simplified.md
     ```

4. **Validation**
   - Verify simplified content preserves all critical information
   - Check that all cross-references remain valid
   - Ensure AI navigation blocks are intact

## Simplification Guidelines
- Focus on brevity without losing technical precision
- Preserve file structure and section organization
- Maintain all links to other documentation
- Keep all code examples that demonstrate patterns
- Simplify explanatory text while keeping key points
- Maintain consistent formatting across documents

## Execution Strategy
Based on what we've seen in `docs/concerns/ui-ux-patterns.md` and the navigation links in other files, we expect to find these potential files (to be confirmed when we list the directory):

1. Process `api-design.md` (referenced from navigation links)
2. Process `form-management.md` (referenced from navigation links)
3. Process `ui-ux-patterns.md` (we've seen this file)
4. Process `authentication.md` (likely exists based on project context)
5. Process any additional files discovered during directory listing

## Post-Simplification Tasks
1. Update our project plan to reflect completed work
2. Verify all simplifications meet our quality standards
