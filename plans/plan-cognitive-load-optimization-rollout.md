# Cognitive Load Optimization Rollout Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the systematic application of cognitive load optimization principles to all existing documentation, following successful testing and validation of the cognitive load (cog-load) measurement and optimization system.

## Context & Achievements

### System Setup Complete ✅
- All cognitive load scripts reorganized and verified in `docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/`
- Consistent `cog-load-` prefix naming implemented across all scripts
- All internal and external script references updated
- Scripts verified and functional:
  - `cog-load-measure.js` - CLS measurement
  - `cog-load-improve.js` - Improvement recommendations  
  - `cog-load-optimize.js` - Pareto-optimal optimization workflow
  - `cog-load-validate.js` - Quality gate validation
  - `cog-load-graph-maintainer.js` - Graph score management
  - `cog-load-graph-analytics.js` - System-wide analytics

### Proof of Concept Success ✅
- Created `docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/README.md` as test case
- Successfully optimized from 61.97 CLS to 56.93 CLS (8.1% improvement)
- Achieved perfect positioning in optimal 55-60 CLS range
- Demonstrated human-in-the-loop validation working correctly
- Proved real-world effectiveness of Pareto-optimal workflow
- Validated information preservation during optimization

### Research-Based Targets Established ✅
- **Optimal Range**: 55-60 CLS (8th-9th grade level, manageable cognitive effort)
- **Risk Thresholds**: <55 (oversimplification), >65 (high cognitive burden)
- **Priority Targets**: Documents >65 CLS require immediate attention

## Phase 1: Baseline Assessment & Prioritization

### Step 1.1: Complete System Baseline
**Objective**: Establish comprehensive baseline for all documents

**Actions**:
```bash
# Measure all documents and update graph
cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-graph-maintainer.js --update-cog-load

# Generate comprehensive analytics report
cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-graph-analytics.js --report
```

**Deliverables**:
- Complete cognitive load scores for all documents in `document-graph.json`
- System-wide analytics report showing distribution and problem areas
- Prioritized list of documents requiring optimization

### Step 1.2: Document Categorization
**Objective**: Classify documents by optimization priority

**Categories**:
- **Critical (>65 CLS)**: Immediate optimization required
- **High (60-65 CLS)**: Optimization beneficial  
- **Optimal (55-60 CLS)**: Monitor only, no changes needed
- **Low (<55 CLS)**: Check for oversimplification

**Actions**:
```bash
# Identify high cognitive load documents
cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-improve.js --high-load
```

### Step 1.3: Historical Baseline (if needed)
**Objective**: Establish "before" state for 80% reduction claim validation

**Question for User**: How should we retrieve original document versions with `AI_NAVIGATION` headers for baseline comparison?
- Git history analysis?
- Archived versions?
- Reconstruction from backups?

## Phase 2: Systematic Document Optimization

### Step 2.1: Critical Documents (>65 CLS)
**Priority**: Immediate
**Approach**: Full Pareto-optimal optimization workflow

**Process for Each Critical Document**:
1. **Pre-optimization Analysis**:
   ```bash
   cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-measure.js --file [document-path]
   cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-improve.js --file [document-path]
   ```

2. **Optimization Execution**:
   ```bash
   cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-optimize.js --file [document-path]
   ```

3. **Post-optimization Validation**:
   ```bash
   cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-validate.js --file [document-path]
   ```

4. **Graph Update**:
   ```bash
   cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-graph-maintainer.js --update-cog-load
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- CLS reduced to 55-60 range
- No essential information lost
- Human validation confirms quality
- Backup created automatically

### Step 2.2: High Priority Documents (60-65 CLS)
**Priority**: Secondary
**Approach**: Targeted improvements

**Process**:
- Same as critical documents but with more conservative optimization targets
- Focus on primary cognitive load driver (readability, lexical, or coherence)
- Stop optimization at first successful reduction into 55-60 range

### Step 2.3: Review Low CLS Documents (<55)
**Priority**: Validation
**Approach**: Check for oversimplification

**Process**:
- Manual review to ensure no critical information was lost
- Consider slight complexity increase if information appears oversimplified
- Validate against original document purpose and audience needs

## Phase 3: Quality Assurance & Validation

### Step 3.1: System Validation
**Objective**: Ensure all optimizations maintain quality

**Actions**:
```bash
# Validate all documents haven't regressed
cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-validate.js --all

# Generate final analytics report
cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-graph-analytics.js --report
```

**Success Criteria**:
- All documents pass validation (no regressions)
- System-wide CLS distribution shows improvement
- No documents above 65 CLS threshold

### Step 3.2: 80% Reduction Claim Validation
**Objective**: Validate improvement claims with statistical analysis

**Requirements**:
- Before/after comparison data
- Statistical significance testing
- Comprehensive documentation of results

**Process**:
1. Compare original baseline vs optimized scores
2. Calculate percentage improvements
3. Generate validation report with evidence
4. Document methodology for reproducibility

## Phase 4: Governance & Maintenance

### Step 4.1: Quality Gate Implementation
**Objective**: Prevent future cognitive load regression

**Implementation**:
- Integrate `cog-load-validate.js` into CI/CD pipeline
- Set up automated alerts for documents exceeding 65 CLS
- Establish review process for new documents

**CI/CD Integration**:
```bash
# Add to build pipeline
cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-validate.js --all
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    echo "❌ Cognitive load validation failed"
    exit /b 1
)
```

### Step 4.2: Maintenance Schedule
**Objective**: Ongoing cognitive load management

**Schedule**:
- **Weekly**: System health check
- **Monthly**: Review new documents and score updates
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive system analysis and optimization review

### Step 4.3: Documentation Updates
**Objective**: Update workflows and documentation

**Tasks**:
- Update `docs-ai-initialise.md` workflow to include cog-load capabilities
- Update `docs-ai-health-check.md` workflow with cog-load validation
- Add `docs/ai/maintenance/ai-cognitive-load-metric.md` to document graph
