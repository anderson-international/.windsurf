# Next Steps: Fix Dashboard Statistics Display

**Goal:** Debug and resolve the issue preventing dashboard statistics from displaying correctly in the UI.

1.  **Diagnose the Client Component:**
    *   The first step is to check what data, if any, is arriving in the front-end component. I will add a `console.log(stats, isLoading, error)` inside `DashboardClient.tsx` to inspect the values received from the `useDashboardStats` hook.

2.  **Verify Data Access & Rendering Logic:**
    *   Based on the console output, I will review the JSX in `DashboardClient.tsx`. The issue is likely a minor mistake in how the nested `stats` object is being accessed (e.g., `stats?.systemStats.total_products`) or a conditional rendering issue related to the `isLoading` state.

3.  **Implement the Fix:**
    *   Once the specific problem is identified, I will correct the code in `DashboardClient.tsx` to ensure the statistics are rendered correctly as they are fetched from the API.
