# AI Documentation Ingestion Workflow Evaluation and Optimization

The `@docs folder contains files designed exclusively for AI models, providing essential context and rules for accurate code generation. These documents must minimize cognitive load and maximize information delivery efficiency.

**Task:**  
Simulate the execution of the `@read-docs.md` workflow as an AI. During this process:

- Track whether any files are missed.
- Evaluate the reading order for logical coherence.
- Note if cross-references are followed or if files are read sequentially.
- Assess the usefulness of AI-specific annotations.

**Output:**  
Produce a concise report addressing:

- Gaps or inefficiencies in file coverage or reading order.
- The effectiveness of cross-referencing and annotation strategies.
- Specific, actionable suggestions to improve the docs, such as:
  - Adding or refining AI annotations.
  - Introducing or restructuring index files.
  - Any other changes to reduce cognitive load and accelerate AI comprehension, while ensuring retention of all necessary rules, standards, and context.

The goal: Enable the AI to rapidly and reliably internalize the documentation, supporting accurate and standards-compliant code generation.
