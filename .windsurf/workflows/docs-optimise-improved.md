# AI Documentation Optimization Workflow (v2.0)

## Purpose
Optimize documentation for maximum AI effectiveness with minimal time investment, focusing on high-impact improvements rather than comprehensive audits.

## Strategy: 80/20 Optimization
Focus on the 20% of docs that provide 80% of coding value.

## Phase 1: Impact Assessment (10 minutes)

// turbo
1. **Analyze current context restoration effectiveness**
```
Test /docs-ai-reboot workflow speed and coverage
```

// turbo  
2. **Review AI ingestion files priority order**
```
Check: docs/ai/ingestion/ directory for file sizes and cognitive load
```

// turbo
3. **Identify high-usage patterns**
```
Which docs get referenced most in cross-references?
Which patterns appear in multiple files?
```

## Phase 2: Quick Wins (20 minutes)

**Priority 1: Critical Path Optimization**
- Ensure `ai-coding-handbook.md` stays under 150 lines
- Verify split compliance files are well-organized
- Check for broken cross-references (we just fixed these!)

**Priority 2: Context Restoration Validation** 
- Test each specialized workflow (`/docs-forms`, `/docs-api`, etc.)
- Ensure load times are under 30 seconds
- Verify coverage is sufficient for task completion

**Priority 3: Anti-Pattern Documentation**
- Consolidate common mistakes into pitfall prevention docs
- Ensure error patterns are easily searchable
- Cross-reference debugging workflows

## Phase 3: Selective Deep Optimization (30 minutes)

**Only if needed based on Phase 1 findings:**

1. **Redundancy Elimination** (if detected)
   - Merge duplicate React patterns across files
   - Consolidate validation rules in central registry
   - Remove outdated cross-references

2. **AI Enhancement Improvements** (if AI_NAVIGATION blocks are unclear)
   - Standardize AI_SUMMARY format across docs
   - Improve cross-reference tooltips
   - Add missing context in navigation blocks

3. **Cognitive Load Reduction** (if files exceed limits)
   - Split any files over 200 lines
   - Extract large code examples to separate files
   - Create focused "cheat sheet" summaries

## Success Metrics

**After optimization, validate:**
- ✅ `/docs-ai-reboot` loads in <30 seconds
- ✅ Specialized workflows load in <45 seconds  
- ✅ No files in `/ai/ingestion/` exceed 200 lines
- ✅ Zero broken cross-references
- ✅ All workflows have `// turbo` automation

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **NEVER** spend more than 1 hour on documentation optimization
❌ **NEVER** optimize docs that aren't used in workflows  
❌ **NEVER** create more files - consolidate instead
✅ **ALWAYS** test context restoration speed after changes
✅ **ALWAYS** prioritize AI ingestion files over maintenance docs
✅ **ALWAYS** measure impact on coding productivity

## Output

Produce a brief report (max 10 bullet points):
- What was optimized and why
- Measured improvement in load times
- Any remaining high-impact opportunities
- Verification that workflows still function correctly

**Goal:** Maximize AI coding effectiveness with minimal optimization overhead.
