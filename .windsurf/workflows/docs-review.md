# AI Documentation Optimization Workflow  

The `@docs` folder contains files designed exclusively for AI models, providing essential context and rules for accurate code generation. These documents must eliminate redundancy, consolidate fragmented information, and maintain up-to-date AI-specific enhancements for optimal ingestion efficiency.  

**Task:**  
Review all files in the `@docs` folder without omission. During this process:  
- Identify duplicate information across files.  
- Detect scattered or fragmented content that could be consolidated.  
- Verify all AI enhancements (e.g., annotations, structured references) are current and preserved.  
- Ensure conciseness without sacrificing intent or critical details.  

**Output:**  
Produce a concise report addressing:  
- Redundant content and opportunities for consolidation.  
- Fragmented information requiring structural reorganization.  
- Specific, actionable suggestions to improve AI ingestion efficiency, such as:  
  - Merging duplicate sections or files.  
  - Restructuring scattered content into centralized references.  
  - Updating/expanding AI annotations for clarity.  
  - Adding metadata or hierarchical indexing for faster navigation.  

**Goal:** Ensure the AI internalizes rules and context with minimal cognitive load, enabling precise and consistent code generation.
