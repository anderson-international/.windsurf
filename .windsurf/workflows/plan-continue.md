You have received a "Continue" instruction. This means you now need to:

1. Refer to our existing plan to establish your next steps
2. Refer to your memories to determine if you have already performed any analsysis regarding these steps before continuing. 
3. Do not re-analyse if this work has already been done.

Once you have completed these tasks, halt and confirm your understanding of the current plan context.
