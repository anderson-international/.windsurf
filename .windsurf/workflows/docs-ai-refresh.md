# AI Context Refresh - Essential Standards

## Purpose
Restore critical AI context after Windsurf continuations in 30 seconds.

## Core Context Loading

// turbo
1. Load essential context with dependencies using graph intelligence
cmd /c node scripts/smart-context-loader.js --workflow=core-context

**Graph-based loading includes:**
- AI Coding Handbook + validation registry dependencies
- Business Context + feature requirements dependencies
- Code quality standards + React patterns relationships

This provides 90% coverage for:
- ⚠️ File size limits (150/200/100 lines)
- ⚠️ TypeScript return types (mandatory)
- 🔥 React performance patterns (memo/callback/useMemo)
- 🎯 Code generation checklist
- 👥 User roles and access control (Admin vs Reviewer)
- 🔐 Authentication strategy (magic link vs dropdown)

## Validation Check

// turbo
```bash
cmd /c node docs/ai/maintenance/scripts/cog-load-graph-maintainer.js
```

Quick validation to ensure document graph consistency before proceeding.

## Memory Refresh
After loading, I should remember:
- Current project: Snuff Specification Builder
- Tech stack: Next.js 14, Prisma, TypeScript, CSS Modules
- User preferences: Mobile-first, simple patterns, solo developer
- Business context: 20 reviewers, 600 products, Admin/Reviewer roles
- Zero-tolerance: File size violations, missing return types

## Quick Validation
I can now generate code that:
✅ Stays under line limits
✅ Has explicit return types  
✅ Uses React performance patterns
✅ Follows project conventions

**Context restoration complete in ~30 seconds**
