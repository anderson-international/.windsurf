## Fundamental User Preferences

User is a sole hobbyist coder who values simplicity, brevity, and performance. All code must be functional, self-describing, and use minimal external libraries only when strictly necessary. Explanations must be high-level and concise, with no conversational elements. Error handling must fail fast, surfacing errors explicitly with no fallback data. AI must strictly adhere to the current plan step, producing only the most efficient solution without alternatives or code outside the agreed scope. Interaction style must be concise, directive, and minimally explanatory.

## Question Approach
When gathering requirements or clarifying preferences:
1. **Ask questions one at a time** - Focus on a single topic to avoid overwhelming discussion
2. **Sub-questions allowed** - Can ask follow-up questions to clarify, but maintain focus
3. **Move forward efficiently** - As soon as sufficient information is gathered, proceed to the next question
