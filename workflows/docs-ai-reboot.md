# AI Context Reboot - Essential Standards

## Purpose
Restore critical AI context after Windsurf continuations in 30 seconds.

## Core Context Loading

// turbo
1. Read the AI Coding Handbook for essential standards
```
Load: docs/ai/ingestion/ai-coding-handbook.md
```

// turbo
2. Read essential business context for user roles
```
Load: docs/project/business-context.md
```

This provides 90% coverage for:
- ⚠️ File size limits (150/200/100 lines)
- ⚠️ TypeScript return types (mandatory)
- 🔥 React performance patterns (memo/callback/useMemo)
- 🎯 Code generation checklist
- 👥 User roles and access control (Admin vs Reviewer)
- 🔐 Authentication strategy (magic link vs dropdown)

## Memory Refresh
After loading, I should remember:
- Current project: Snuff Specification Builder
- Tech stack: Next.js 14, Prisma, TypeScript, CSS Modules
- User preferences: Mobile-first, simple patterns, solo developer
- Business context: 20 reviewers, 600 products, Admin/Reviewer roles
- Zero-tolerance: File size violations, missing return types

## Quick Validation
I can now generate code that:
✅ Stays under line limits
✅ Has explicit return types  
✅ Uses React performance patterns
✅ Follows project conventions

**Context restoration complete in ~30 seconds**
